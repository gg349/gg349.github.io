Hi, this is my personal website, where you can find how to contact me and a few links to what I have been working on.

I have been working with data modeling, reporting and visualization for over a decade, first in the energy business and now at Doodle. I have a strong background in timeseries, machine learning and dynamical systems and apply this to physical systems, business models and user behaviour models, with the goal of enabling quantitative decision making.
