I have a strong background in dynamical systems, system identification, linear and nonlinear modelling, and apply this in fluid dynamics, acoustics and thermoacoustics.

I am interested in data analysis, modelling and identification, and currently do so for the gas turbine industry. I deal with various data sources and low-order models to design the gas turbines of tomorrow.
