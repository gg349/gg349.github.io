This theoretical study investigates spinning and standing modes in azimuthally sym- metric annular combustion chambers. Both modes are observed in experiments and simulations, and an existing model predicts that spinning modes are the only stable state of the system (Noiray, Bothien {\&} Schuermans, 2011, Comb. Theory Modelling 15(5) 585â€“606). We extend this model to take into account the effect that the acoustic azimuthal velocity has on the flames, and propose a phenomenological model based on experiments performed on transversely forced flames. This model contains a parameter, $\delta$, that quantifies the influence that the transversal excitation has on the fluctuating heat release. For small values of $\delta$, spinning modes are the only stable state of the system, while for large values of $\delta$, standing modes are the only stable state. There is also an intermediate range of $\delta$ for which both spinning and standing modes are stable. 1
